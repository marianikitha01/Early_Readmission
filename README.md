# Early Readmission Prediction using Random Forest and SMOTE

This project analyzes a diabetic dataset to predict hospital readmission using machine learning models. The goal is to predict whether a diabetic patient will be readmitted within 30 days based on their medical and demographic data.

### Project Description
The project involves:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding dataset features and relationships.

2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data.

3. Modeling: Building machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict readmission.

4. Evaluation: Assessing model performance with accuracy and other metrics.

### Dataset
The dataset contains information such as patient demographics, medical history, lab results, and hospital admission details. It is available in Data/diabetic_data.csv.

### Modeling
Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest.

Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, classification report.
